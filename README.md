### Getting Started
First clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/lisovskey/crowdfach.git
```
Be sure that you have ruby 2.4.1 installed

Then go ahead and update gems:
```
cd crowdfach
bundle
```
SQLite is used for development mode so if you want to go production you'll need PostgreSQL be installed and configured according to `config/database.yml` production mode

Let's get it started:
```
rails s
```
Congratulations!
